# Crypto Brain Game

An HTML5 game about cryptocurrency and the blockchain.

Created by Dr Crypto Brain and Play Curious, with support from Science Animation, France IOI, and the Blaise Pascal Foundation.

Developed using the [https://github.com/play-curious/booyah](Booyah game engine).

## Development

1. Install dependencies:

- npm and gulp-cli if you don't have them.
- `npm install`

2. Clone or download https://github.com/play-curious/booyah into a sub-directory as `booyah`
3. Use `gulp dist` to create a minified version, useful for deployment.

### Building Electron app

To build Windows on Mac, getting around 64- 32-bit compatibility issues, use Docker as a solution.
